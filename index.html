        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
My journey as a Master of Information Technology graduate has been a dynamic exploration of technology, collaboration, and continuous learning, all underscored by a passion for software development. Through a series of diverse and impactful projects, I've honed my skills, working both independently and in collaborative teams, and I'm excited to take on new challenges.
I've led and participated in the development of several significant applications, demonstrating my commitment to delivering valuable solutions.</p>
<p>
My role in a team that created a Text-Based Patient Management System allowed me to not only develop Java-based software but also cultivate project management and leadership abilities. The agile methodology I employed ensured effective collaboration and conflict resolution within the team.
The development of a Public Transport Android Application further expanded my technical proficiency and introduced me to modern software technologies. I embraced collaboration, enhancing my communication skills and the ability to work closely with a diverse group of team members.
My experience culminated in the development of a Diet and Weight Loss Web Application, a project that I presented at the Monash University IT Postgraduate Expo. This endeavor challenged me to balance technical proficiency with a deep understanding of user experience, and I received invaluable feedback from industry mentors.
My project-based journey has been a rich source of learning and personal growth, and I am excited to leverage this experience in contributing to innovative and impactful projects in the future.</p>
